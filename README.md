# Time Series Analysis

This repository contains a collection of custom built models and algorithms for the course Time Series Analysis of Humboldt University of Berlin. Use these at your own peril.

## Installation

The first step is to install all requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The second step is to install the repo as a package (this makes importing modules from a parent-directory possible):

```bash
pip install -e .
```
You can skip this step. However, imports will start failing. If you do not want to install random code from an untrusted repository, you can move any notebooks/scripts you want to execute into the parent directory. This should do the trick too.
